# 💎 PRETTY COINZ: THE AESTHETIC SIGNAL
> **“Evidence that beauty is a data point worth tracking.”**

---

### [ 🛰️ FEATURED ARTIFACT: THE ROSE ]
**Current Status: 🟢 ACTIVE SIGNAL**

This artifact represents the core of the **Beauty Index**. It is a study in high-contrast persistence—where specialized artistry meets traditional currency. This is not about utility; it is about the "Aesthetic Alpha" found in the physical world.

### [ 🛰️ SYNTHETIC CO-PILOT ]
**Technical Architecture:** This repository and the broader **Moore Signal** ecosystem were manifest through an iterative rhythmic exchange between **Angela N. Moore** and the **Gemini Neural Models**.

The architecture balances technical data (NASA/Beal) with the curator’s personal aesthetic vision—blending AI precision with the human eye for "Specialized Numismatics."
